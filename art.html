					<p class="artMedia">22x28 inches, Ink pen on poster board</p>
					<p>
						This piece was inspired by the Hopf fibration, visualized as a 
						stereographic projection of the 3-sphere into R3. I think the 3D 
						projection of the Hopf fibration is really cool because of how it allows 
						the viewer to "see" in higher dimensions, and it reminded me of a 
						pineapple.

						This is a graphic design I created using Adobe Photoshop in 2019

						<a href="https://dukeml.org/">Duke Undergraduate Machine Learning (DUML)</a>.  
						This design was used on promotional materials and printed on 
						hundreds of t-shirts and sweatshirts that were given out to 
						participants. Many thanks to my model Daniel Egitto, who sat 
						as a figure for the "neural network man"!
