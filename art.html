					<h3 style="artTitle"><em>Hopf Fibration with Pineapple Scales</em>, 2016</h3>
					<p style="artMedia">22x28 inches, Ink pen on poster board</p>
					<p>
						This piece was inspired by the Hopf fibration, visualized as a stereographic 
						projection of the 3-sphere into R3.  I loved this shape and how it allows the 
						viewer to "see" in higher dimensions, and coincidentally, it reminded me of a 
						pineapple.

					<p style="artMedia">Charcoal on paper</p>
					<p>
						This is a drawing I did of Jason Momoa.  I was trying to get more practice in 
						charcoals, and I was really taken with how dramatic his countenance was.

					<p style="artMedia">Charcoal and ink on paper</p>
					<p>
						This is a drawing I did of Danny Trejo. To be very clear, I do not believe any 
						high-ranking government position should be considered entry-level. This is from 
						an elaborate fantasy I have where my life is a Robert Rodriguez movie and Danny 
						Trejo happens to be the president of the United States.

						In 2016, I did a series of drawings of my friends at work in various class subjects.

						This "fake Polaroid" was a simple exercise in copying what I saw in front 
						me: a couple loose playing cards.
