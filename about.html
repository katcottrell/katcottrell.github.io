					<strong>What is this?  Are you taunting me?</strong>
					<br>
					Absolutely not!  This is my profile image on many platforms.  
					(I avoid posting images of myself for digital privacy reasons.)  It is 
					is a small green alien widely known as the "Cosmic Cutie" from the cover 
					art of one of my favorite book series, 
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">
						<em>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em></a>.  
					Fun fact:  While I am myself a fan of the Cosmic Cutie, H2G2 author 
					Douglas Adams was decidedly not, quoted as saying: "I <em>hate</em> the little 
					green blob and have spent years locked in arguments with my publishers with me trying 
					to get rid of the obscene little thing."  Sorry, Douglas!
