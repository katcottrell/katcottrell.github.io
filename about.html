					<b>Absolutely not!</b>
				</p>
				<p class="faqText">
					This is my profile image on many platforms.  It is a small green 
					alien widely known as the "Cosmic Cutie" from the cover of one of my favorite book 
					series, 
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">
						<em>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em></a>.  
				</p>
				<p class="faqText">
					Fun fact:  While I am myself a fan of the Cosmic Cutie, H2G2 author Douglas Adams 
					was decidedly not, quoted as saying: "I <em>hate</em> the little green blob and 
					have spent years locked in arguments with my publishers with me trying to get rid 
					of the obscene little thing."  Sorry, Douglas!
