						Hello!  I'm Katherine "Kat" Cottrell.  I attend Duke University as a computer science 
						student.  I am set to graduate with my Bachelor of Science in computer science in 2022.  I 
						have special interest in data science, data visualization, and image analysis.  
						In my spare time outside of coding, I enjoy reading, creating visual art, and 
						spending quality time with my two cats.

				<h2>Are you currently seeking employment?</h2>
				<p>
					Yes I am!  I am currently on a temporary leave from Duke University due to COVID-19 and 
					I am looking for employment.  I have confirmed my leave through the spring 2020 semester, 
					and I am likely to extend my leave through the summer 2021 semester.  Interested in finding out if I might be a good 
					fit for your team? Please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> any time! I'd love to 
					meet you.

				<h2>What is your name?</h2>

					My full name is Katherine Cottrell, but I often go by Kat.  Either is great.

				<h2>What is this?  Are you taunting me?</h2>
				<p>
					Absolutely not!  This is my profile image on many platforms.  
					(I avoid posting images of myself for digital privacy reasons.)  It 
					is a small green alien widely known as the "Cosmic Cutie" from the cover 
					art of one of my favorite book series, 
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">
						<em>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em>
					</a>.  
					<br>
					Fun fact:  While I am myself a fan of the Cosmic Cutie, H2G2 author 
					Douglas Adams was decidedly not, quoted as saying: "I <em>hate</em> the little 
					green blob and have spent years locked in arguments with my publishers with me trying 
					to get rid of the obscene little thing."  Sorry, Douglas!
