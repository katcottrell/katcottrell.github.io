			<blockquote cite="https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python">
				<p>"Machine learning arises from this question: could a computer go beyond 
					'what we know how to order it to perform' and learn on its own how to perform 
					a specified task? Could a computer surprise us? Rather than programmers 
					crafting data-processing rules by hand, could a computer automatically 
					learn these rules by looking at data?"</p>

			<p>This is because while the other skills listed here refer to single, specific 
				languages or tools, machine learning is a broad and complex field, and I 
				want to explain it carefully and correctly.  -KC 8/28/20</p>
			<p>I can easily, however, explain my history with machine learning (ML).  I first 
				began learning about machine learning when I took on a position with the 
				Duke Undergraduate Machine Learning executive board.  As an executive board 
				member, I planned and hosted events to educate undergraduates on machine 
				learning and big data topics.  One of these events was our annual Duke 
				Machine Learning Day, a day dedicated to Machine Learning, attended by 
				undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, and national experts in 
				machine learning alike.  Others included bimonthly lectures by machine 
				learning researchers, all of which I promoted and attended.  I also attended 
				events hosted by one of our sponsors, 
				<a href="https://infiniaml.com/">
					InfiniaML</a>, 
				which taught ML basics and allowed me to speak with both new and experienced 
				developers about working in ML.</p>
			
			<p>In the fall of 2019, I took Introduction to Machine Learning at Duke University, 
				taught by 
				<a href="https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/lawrence-carin">
					Dr. Lawrence Carin</a>, 
				which included both a series of lecture modules and through in-person 
				learning experiences.  In this course I was able to learn a great deal more 
				about the mathematics and software behind machine learning, as well as the 
				applications of such technology.</p>
			
			<p>For more information on machine learning, I encourage you to look into
				<a href="https://www.coursera.org/programs/duke-university-courses-gp9dy/browse?authProvider=duke&browseProductType=COURSE&productId=8BJHzZD_EeiKohJBs5wRGA&productType=course&searchKeyword=introduction+to+machine+learning&showMiniModal=true">
					Dr. Carin’s online Coursera course on machine learning</a>.  
				If you are interested in my personal history with machine learning, please 
				keep checking back—I hope to post more information on my experiences and 
				work with ML soon!</p>
