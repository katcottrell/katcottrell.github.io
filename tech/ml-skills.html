						<p>"Machine learning arises from this question: could a computer go beyond 
							'what we know how to order it to perform' and learn on its own how to perform 
							a specified task? Could a computer surprise us? Rather than programmers 
							crafting data-processing rules by hand, could a computer automatically 
							learn these rules by looking at data?"</p>

						I first 
						began learning about machine learning when I took on a position with the 
						Duke Undergraduate Machine Learning executive board.  As an executive board 
						member, I planned and hosted events to educate undergraduates on machine 
						learning and big data topics.  
					</p>
					<p>
						One of these events was our annual Duke Machine Learning Day, attended by 
						undergraduates, graduate students, Duke faculty, and national experts in 
						machine learning.  Others included bimonthly lectures by machine learning 
						researchers, all of which I promoted and attended.  I also attended events 
						hosted by one of our sponsors, 
						<a href="https://infiniaml.com/">InfiniaML</a>, 
						which taught ML basics and allowed me to speak with both new and 
						experienced developers about working in machine learning.

						In the fall of 2019, I took an Introduction to Machine Learning course at 
						Duke University, which included both a series of online lecture modules, 
						"in-person learning experiences," and hands-on projects.  In this course I 
						was able to learn more about the mathematics and software behind machine 
						learning, as well as the applications and ethics of such technology.
