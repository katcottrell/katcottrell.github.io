						<p>"Machine learning arises from this question: could a computer go beyond 
							'what we know how to order it to perform' and learn on its own how to perform 
							a specified task? Could a computer surprise us? Rather than programmers 
							crafting data-processing rules by hand, could a computer automatically 
							learn these rules by looking at data?"</p>

					<p>I first 
						began learning about machine learning when I took on a position with the 
						Duke Undergraduate Machine Learning executive board.  As an executive board 
						member, I planned and hosted events to educate undergraduates on machine 
						learning and big data topics.  One of these events was our annual Duke 
						Machine Learning Day, a day dedicated to Machine Learning, attended by 
						undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, and national experts in 
						machine learning alike.  Others included bimonthly lectures by machine 
						learning researchers, all of which I promoted and attended.  I also attended 
						events hosted by one of our sponsors, 
						<a href="https://infiniaml.com/">
							InfiniaML
						</a>, 
						which taught ML basics and allowed me to speak with both new and experienced 
						developers about working in ML.
					</p>
					<p>In the fall of 2019, I took Introduction to Machine Learning at Duke University, 
						taught by 
						<a href="https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/lawrence-carin">
							Dr. Lawrence Carin
						</a>, 
						which included both a series of lecture modules and through in-person 
						learning experiences.  In this course I was able to learn a great deal more 
						about the mathematics and software behind machine learning, as well as the 
						applications of such technology.
