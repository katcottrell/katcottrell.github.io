			<p>The programming language <strong>R</strong> was developed in the 1990s, a 
				descendant of Scheme.  It’s free and excellent for:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Statistics</li>
				<li>Graphics and visualization</li>
				<li>Data manipulation and analysis</li>
				<li>Programs benefitted by R’s use of vectors</li>
				<li>Web applications</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>What is R Shiny?</h2>
			<h2>My experience with R and R Shiny</h2>
			<p>I first learned R as a student researcher in Duke’s Data+ program.  My 
				research team was investigating the effects of different environmental 
				stressors on lakes in the IISD’s Experimental Lakes Area, and we had 
				over fifty years of massive datasets.  We used R to wrangle and clean 
				the data, and then to develop an interactive R Shiny website for users 
				to see the data for themselves.

					That website can be found here.</a> </p>
			<p>I later performed similar work on a different dataset, this time over fifty 
				years of Duke University student enrollment data.  I worked with a team 
				of researchers to create another interactive R Shiny website to show and 
				allow users to explore the data for themselves.
