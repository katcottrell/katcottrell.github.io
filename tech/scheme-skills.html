					<h2>What are Racket, Lisp, and Scheme?</h2>

						<p>“The list, Lisp's native data structure, is largely 
							responsible for such growth of utility. The 
							simple structure and natural applicability of 
							lists are reflected in functions that are 
							amazingly nonidiosyncratic.”

					<p>Lisp stands for “list processing.”  Popularly known for their 
						extensive use of parentheses, Lisp languages were 
						originally used largely for research in artificial 
						intelligence.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							1958 - Lisp was created by John McCarthy at MIT. 
							Lisp is now one of the oldest families of 
							programming languages still in common use.
						</li>
						<li>
							1970’s - Scheme, a dialect of Lisp, was created 
							by Guy L. Steele and Gerald Jay Sussman at the 
							MIT AI Lab.
						</li>
						<li>
							1995 - PLT Inc created what later came to be 
							known as Racket.  Racket is based on Scheme and 
							was created for teaching purposes.  PLT Inc also 
							created DrScheme, an environment for Racket.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Lisp is used mostly for applications that can make good 
						use of its power for processing lists and similar data 
						structures.  Racket is used mostly in pedagogical 
						settings, as the structure of the language cleanly 
						parallels core ideas in computer science, such as data 
						structures, eval/apply, recursion, conditionals, typing, 
						and memory.
					</p>
					<h2>How do I know Racket?</h2>
					<p>
						I learned Racket from Dr. Bruce Randall at Duke 
						University in his CS230 course Discrete Mathematics for 
						Computer Science.  We learned basic Scheme as a 
						programmatic demonstration of concepts in discrete 
						mathematics.
					</p>
					<h2>What can I do with Racket?</h2>
					<p>In my discrete mathematics course, I learned how to use Scheme to…</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Draw fractals of my own design</li>
						<li>Encrypt, decrypt, sign, and verify RSA messages</li>
						<li>Solve geometric problems using recursion</li>
						<li>Calculate terms in sequences such as Fibonacci using streams</li>
						<li>Memoize intermediate results to speed up calculation</li>
						<li>And more</li>
					</ul>
