				<p>"OpenRefine (previously Google Refine) is a powerful tool for working with 
        messy data: cleaning it; transforming it from one format into another; and 
        extending it with web services and external data."</p>

			<p>Most professionals are familiar with Microsoft Excel’s basic use for managing 
				spreadsheets and flat, rectangular data.  However, Excel has a vast assortment 
				of tools and functions for spreadsheet manipulation that many users never 
				venture into.  Some of these helpful utilities that I have learned to use 
				include:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Mathematical and logical functions</li>
				<li>Financial, logical, text, date/time, lookup/reference, mathematical, 
					statistical, engineering, cube, information, compatibility, and web 
					formulas</li>
				<li>Advanced and conditional formatting options</li>
				<li>Column delimitation</li>
				<li>Advanced graphics</li>
				<li>Formulas across multiple sheets</li>
				<li>Pivot tables</li>
				<li>Advanced filtration (unique values, etc)</li>
				<li>Error checking</li>
				<li>File protections</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Additionally, OpenRefine offers great solutions for data wrangling and cleaning.  
				Using the web interface, users can import messy, difficult-to-use data, and 
				turn it into an easy-to use, well-formatted file.  OpenRefine features 
				include filtration, faceting, clustering, data extension, expressions, 
				regular expressions, and reconciliation.  Users can also use General Refine 
				Expression Language (GREL) to transform the data.</p>
			
			<p>It’s possible to perform most of the functions offered by Microsoft Excel and 
				OpenRefine using simple programs written in languages like R and Python, 
				but for a quick simple fix, Excel and OpenRefine are great options.</p>
