					<p>MATLAB, short for <em>matrix laboratory</em>, was developed by MathWorks founders in the 1970s and 1980s 
						with the goal of creating a programming language for applied mathematics and matrix calculations.  
						MATLAB is great for:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Mathematical computation</li>
						<li>Data visualization and graphics</li>
						<li>Algorithm implementation</li>
						<li>Computations involving matrix or vector formulations</li>
						<li>Model-based design</li>
						<li>Simulation</li>
						<li>Data analysis</li>
						<li>Science, engineering, and other industry applications</li>
						<li>App and GUI development</li>
					</ul>
					<p>MATLAB comes with a comprehensive library of mathematical functions and toolboxes for specialized 
						applications like deep learning, image processing, aerospace, parallel computing, finance, 
						signal processing, and many more.</p>
					<h2>My MATLAB Experience</p>
					<p>I learned MATLAB in my first year of college in a course taught by 
						<a href="https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/michael-gustafson">Dr. Michael Gustafson</a>.  In the 
						course, we learned to model physical systems, optimize parameters, perform numerical 
						integration, find roots of equations; how to perform simultaneous equation solving, 
						finite difference methods, matrix analysis, linear programming, dynamic programming, 
						heuristic solutions; and throughout the course, how to document our code and results 
						using Latex.</p>
					<p>Since then, I have continued to use MATLAB for personal projects, especially enjoying its 
						graphical and visualization capacities.</p>
					<p>Here is a plot I rendered in MATLAB in the summer of 2019.  Similar to a Möbius strip, it 
						has only one edge and only one side.  I was able to create the rotating video of the plot 
						using <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/41093-create-video-of-rotating-3d-plot?s_tid=prof_contriblnk">code</a> 
						by Alan Jennings of UDayton—thanks Alan!</p>
