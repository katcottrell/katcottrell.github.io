					<p>
						MATLAB, short for <em>matrix laboratory</em>, was developed by MathWorks founders in the 1970s and 1980s 
						with the goal of creating a programming language for applied mathematics and matrix calculations.
					</p>
					<p>
						MATLAB is great for:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Mathematical computation</li>
						<li>Data visualization and graphics</li>
						<li>Algorithm implementation</li>
						<li>Computations involving matrix or vector formulations</li>
						<li>Model-based design</li>
						<li>Simulation</li>
						<li>Data analysis</li>
						<li>Science, engineering, and other industry applications</li>
						<li>App and GUI development</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						MATLAB comes with a comprehensive library of mathematical functions and toolboxes for specialized 
						applications like deep learning, image processing, aerospace, parallel computing, finance, 
						signal processing, and many more.
					</p>
					<h2>How do I know MATLAB?</h2>
					<p>
						I learned MATLAB in my Computational Methods in Engineering course at Duke University. In the 
						course, we learned to model physical systems, optimize parameters, perform numerical integration, 
						find roots of equations, perform simultaneous equation solving, use finite difference methods, do 
						matrix analysis, implement linear and dynamic programming, and find heuristic solutions.
					</p>
					<h2>What can I do with MATLAB?</h2>
					<p>
						Since learning MATLAB in class, I have continued to use MATLAB for personal projects, especially 
						enjoying its graphical and visualization capacities.  One sample of my work in MATLAB is the 
						above plot I rendered in the summer of 2019. Similar to a Möbius strip, it has only one edge and 
						only one side. I was able to create the rotating video of the plot using code by Alan Jennings of 
						UDayton—thanks Alan!
