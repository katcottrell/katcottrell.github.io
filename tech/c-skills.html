					<h2>What are C, C++, and C#?</h2>
					<p>
						<b>C, C++, and C# are not necessarily similar.</b>  I have 
						combined them into one tab because I have less experience 
						with them than I do in the other programming languages I know.
						<br>
						<b>C</b> is a programming language.  C was created in the 1970s 
						by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs with the goal of creating 
						utilities for a new version of Unix.  While it is a high level 
						language, C is designed to be compiled and provides low-level 
						access to computer memory.
						<br>
						<b>C++</b> is another computer language.  It was created by Bjarne 
						Stroustrup in the early 1980s at Bell Labs.  C++ is considered 
						an extension of C, to provide higher-level features like classes, 
						inheritance, and references.
						<br>
						<b>C#</b> (pronounced C sharp) is also a programming language, 
						but it is not a direct extension of C.  C# was created by Anders 
						Hejlsberg at Microsoft in 1999, with the intention of creating 
						a language similar to C, but more object-oriented in nature.  
						C# is much more abstracted than C and C++, and provides 
						high-level assistance like garbage collection and compiler 
						warnings.
						<br>
						Here is a handy comparison of the three languages from

					<h2>How do I know C, C++, and C#?</h2>
					<p>
						I learned rudimentary C in my Computer Architecture course at 
						Duke University, where it was taught as a way to familiarize 
						students with computer memory.
						<br>
						I learned C++ in a 2D Computer Graphics course at Duke, where 
						I used it to efficiently manage pixel values and create graphics.
						<br>
						I learned C# as an intern at Nextech Systems, where it was used 
						to support the Angular framework behind our company product 
						(IntelleChartPRO, an electronic medical record system designed 
						for ophthalmology practices).
					</p>
					<h2>What can I do with C, C++, and C#?</h2>
					<p>
						Unfortunately my contracts prevent me from sharing my past work 
						in these languages, but I have a basic understanding of and can 
						implement basic functions in C, C++, and C#.
