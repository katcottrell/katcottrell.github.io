			<p>C was first developed by Bell Laboratories in the 1970s with the goal of 
				creating utilities for a new version of Unix.  C is great for:  </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Both high- and low-level programming</li>
				<li>Structured programming utilizing multiple functions</li>
				<li>Deliberate memory management</li>
				<li>Fast, efficient calculations</li>
				<li>Portability (can be used in many environments)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Most programmers will freely admit that C is not the simplest language to learn, 
				but its ubiquity (used in the Microsoft Windows kernel, Linux, Mac OS X, 
				Android, and many more) and advantages make it a time-tested and enduring 
				language.</p>
			<p>I first learned C in a Computer Architecture class at Duke taught by 
				<a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~alvy/">Dr. Alvin Lebeck</a>.  
				The course focused on teaching how computers store and manipulate information 
				to perform computation, but the course also taught and used C to demonstrate 
				concepts of memory management.</p>
