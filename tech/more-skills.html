						<h3>Agile</h3>
						<p class="listText">
							Agile is a system of practices (particularly for software development) 
							that uses teamwork and a cyclical development process to keep 
							production levels up and moving.  I have used Agile practices in my 
							internship at Nextech Systems and in software design courses at Duke.  
							We also used project management tools like 
							<a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/planning-poker">
								Planning Poker</a> and 
							<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">
								Atlassian’s Jira</a> in our Agile practices.

						<h3>SCRUM</h3>
						<p class="listText">
							SCRUM is a framework, also most often used in software development, 
							for product development.  SCRUM breaks production into iterations 
							called “sprints,” in which small teams plan goals, attempt to complete 
							them with frequent team check-ins, and discuss successes and challenges 
							sprintly.  SCRUM is a great way to keep a team on track and ensure 
							that practices are responsive to the needs of the production process.
							I also used SCRUM in my internship at Nextech Systems and in software 
							design courses at Duke.

						<h3>Planning</h3>
						<p class="listText">
							In addition to Agile and SCRUM, I am familiar with many tools for 
							planning, such as Gantt charts, LibrePlan, and the built-in project 
							planning capabilities offered by GitHub and GitLab.

						<h3>Communication</h3>
						<p class="listText">
							Communication is essential to good team dynamics and productivity!  
							I have experience using popular communication/team organization tools 
							such as  
							<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/log-in">
							   Microsoft Teams</a>, 
							<a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>,

						<h3>Enthusiasm</h3>
						<p class="listText">
							I love working in teams!  As a young developer, I really enjoy 
							getting to work with more experienced teammates, bonding with other

						<h3>Microsoft applications</h3>
						<p class="listText">
							I have had much experience with the various Microsoft applications, 
							including not only Microsoft 365 apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, 
							OneDrive, Outlook, and Teams, but also more specialized tools like 
							Azure Data Studio, Database Compare, Remote Desktop Connection,

						<h3>Graphic design</h3>
						<p class="listText">
							My most underrated skill is my graphic design ability.  I am 
							proficient in Adobe Photoshop, and have also used tools like Adobe 
							Illustrator and even PowerPoint to whip up quick graphics.  This 
							can be invaluable to production, as it cuts out the need for 
							third-party contractors and long wait times for simple graphic 
							products.  I also have some limited experience with 3D modeling 
							tools like AutoCAD, SketchUp, and Rhino 6.

						<h3>Going green</h3>
						<p class="listText">
							I’m a big fan of any effort to help the environment and minimize 
							carbon footprints!  Several years ago, I started and single 
							handedly ran a recycling program at my school.  The program recycled 
							hundreds of plastic and glass bottles every week.  Interested in 
							starting a green initiative at your workplace?  I’d love to help 
							out!
