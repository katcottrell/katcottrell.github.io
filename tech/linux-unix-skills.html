				<p>"From smartphones to cars, supercomputers to home appliances, home desktops to 
        enterprise servers, the Linux operating system is everywhere . . . besides being 
        the platform of choice to run desktops, servers, and embedded systems across the 
        globe, Linux is one of the most reliable, secure and worry-free operating systems 
        available."</p>

			<p><strong>Unix</strong> dates back to the 1960s, now used in applications like servers, workstations, 
				and PCs.  Unix is neither free nor open-source.  <strong>Linux</strong> was famously developed 
				in the 1990s by Linus Torvalds with the goal of creating a free, open-source 
				operating system.  Linux has a lot to offer users, for example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>GNU Bash:</strong>  A command-line interpreter and command language 
					which takes text commands entered by the user, and will then perform 
					functions according to the entered functions. </li>
				<li><strong>LibreOffice:</strong>  A free, open-source office suite including 
					programs like Writer (a word processor, similar to Microsoft Word), Calc 
					(a spreadsheet program, similar to Microsoft Excel), Impress (a 
					presentation program, similar to Microsoft PowerPoint), and more.</li>
				<li>Graphics manipulation programs like <strong>GIMP</strong> and 
					<strong>Blender</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong>Mozilla Firefox:</strong>  A free, open-source web browser.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>I first knowingly interacted with Linux when I accidentally bricked my Windows computer 
				in 2016 and had to run Linux from an external hard drive in order to complete my 
				schoolwork.  It was frustrating, but an insightful experience!  I now know how to 
				navigate basic Linux OS distributions and GNU bash.</p>
