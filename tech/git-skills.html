						<b>Git</b> is a version-control system used for tracking changes 
						made to code files in software development.  
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>GitHub</b> hosts servers for version control using Git.  
						Using GitHub, developers can collaborate on projects and save their work 
						to a mutually accessible platform that allows them to track changes, 
						revert undesirable changes, request new features, manage tasks, and 
						provide documentation for their projects.  Collaborative version control 
						is essential for collaborative coding.  GitHub’s basic services 
						are free, with more tiers of service available for charge.  
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to GitHub, I have experience using <b>GitLab</b>, a similar 
						service with continuous integration advantages.
