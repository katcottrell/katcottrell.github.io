					<p><strong>Git</strong> is a version-control system used for tracking changes 
						made to code files in software development.  <strong>GitHub, Inc</strong> 
						is the corporation that hosts servers for version control using Git.  
						Using GitHub, developers can collaborate on projects and save their work 
						to a mutually accessible platform that allows them to track changes, 
						revert undesirable changes, request new features, manage tasks, and 
						provide documentation for their projects.  
						GitHub is essential for collaborative coding.  GitHub’s basic services 
						are free, with more tiers of service available for charge.  In addition 
						to GitHub, I have experience using <strong>GitLab</strong>, a similar 
						service with continuous integration advantages.</p>
