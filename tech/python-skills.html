			<h2>What is Python?</h2>
			<blockquote cite="https://www.python.org/">
				<p>"Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language 
					with dynamic semantics."</p>

			<p>Python was developed in the 1990s, and has relatively quickly become one of 
				the most popular programming languages in the world.  Python is great 
				for:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Beginners to coding (but not only beginners!)</li>
				<li>Backend web development</li>
				<li>Data analytics</li>
				<li>Mathematical and scientific projects</li>
				<li>Projects that use one of Python’s many libraries, including 
					packages for data analytics, image processing, machine 
					learning, and more!</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>My Python experience</h2>
			<p>I originally taught myself the basics of Python when I learned that an 
				engineering course I had taken replaced the introductory 
				computer science course at my university.  The engineering course 
				taught MATLAB while the computer science course taught Python, and I 
				didn’t want to be missing the Python skills, so I self-taught the 
				basics using Eric Matthes’s <em>Python Crash Course</em>.  Later, I 
				learned a great deal more about Python in my computation of  linear 
				algebra class, where I used NumPy, and my Everything Data class, where 
				I learned Pandas, machine learning methods, and much more using the 
				Python language.  </p>
