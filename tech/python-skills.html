						<p>
							"Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming

					<p>
						Python is a  general-purpose programming language general-purpose programming 
						language.  It was created by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica 
						in the 1990s, and has quickly become one of the most popular programming 
						languages in the world.
					</p>
					<p>
						Python is great for:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Beginners to coding (but not only beginners!)</li>
						<li>Backend web development</li>
						<li>Data analytics</li>
						<li>Mathematical and scientific projects</li>
						<li>Projects that use one of Python’s many libraries, including 
							packages for data analytics, image processing, machine 
							learning, and more!</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>How do I know Python?</h2>
					<p>
						I originally taught myself the basics of Python when I learned that an 
						engineering course taught in MATLAB I had taken replaced the introductory 
						computer science course taught in Python at my university.  I didn’t want to be 
						missing Python skills, so I self-taught the basics using Eric Matthes’s 
						<em>Python Crash Course</em>. Later, I learned a great deal more about Python in 
						my computation of linear algebra class, where I used NumPy, and my Everything 
						Data class, where I learned Pandas, machine learning methods, and much more using 
						the Python language.
					</p>
					<h2>What can I do with Python?</h2>
					<p>I can use Python to…</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Write and use functions that accept a variable input and return a 
							desired output</li>
						<li>Use NumPy to manipulate and calculate matrices</li>
						<li>Use Pandas for data manipulation and analysis</li>
						<li>Use Matplotlib to create, manipulate, and print plots and images</li>
						<li>Use OpenCV for image analysis functions</li>
						<li>Use TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch and Scikit-learn for machine learning 
							applications</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						A sample of my work in Python can be seen in the video above, in which I 
						use k-means clustering to determine the dominant color groups in an image 
						of an iris.
