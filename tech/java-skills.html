					<h2>What is Java?</h2>

					<p>
						Java is an object-oriented programming language.  It 
						was created by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 
						the 1990s, originally with the goal of creating 
						digital interactive television.  Today, Java is one 
						of the most commonly used programming languages in 
						the world.
					</p>
					<p>
						Java is great for:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Single-computer applications</li>
						<li>Webpage applets</li>
						<li>Fast execution</li>
						<li>Readable, easy-to-learn code</li>
						<li>Scientific and mathematical projects</li>
						<li>Corporate projects</li>
						<li>Projects benefitted by object-oriented programming</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>How do I know Java?</h2>
					<p>
						I first learned Java in my Algorithms and Data Structures 
						class at Duke. The course was taught with the goal of 
						learning to design, develop, debug, and test Java 
						programs; implement data structures; and evaluate the 
						time and space complexity of iterative and 
						recursively-defined algorithms.
					</p>
					<p>
						I later used Java in my Software Design and Implementation 
						course at Duke, in which I used Java to write many 
						programs, with the goal of strengthening my software 
						design skills.
					</p>
					<h2>What can I do with Java?</h2>
					<p>I can use Java to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Solve programming challenge questions</li>
						<li>Write programs utilizing good object-oriented design 
							and practice, such as the Pac-Man game demoed in 
							the video above.</li>
						<li>Extend and modify existing programs</li>
					</ul>
