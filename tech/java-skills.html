			<p>Java was developed in the 1990s, originally with the goal of creating digital 
				interactive television, but is now one of the most commonly used programming 
				languages in the world. Java is great for:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Single-computer applications</li>
				<li>Webpage applets</li>
				<li>Fast execution</li>
				<li>Readable, easy-to-learn code</li>
				<li>Scientific and mathematical projects</li>
				<li>Corporate projects</li>
				<li>Projects benefitted by object-oriented programming</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>I learned Java in my Algorithms and Data Structures class at Duke, taught by 
				<a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ola/">Dr. Owen Astrachan</a>.  The 
				course was taught with the goal of learning to design, develop, debug, 
				and test Java programs, implement data structures, and evaluate the time 
				and space complexity of iterative and recursively-defined algorithms.</p>
