			<p><strong>HTML</strong>, or <strong>Hypertext Markup Language</strong>, is a markup language 
				used to create visual web pages.  It was developed in the 1990s, originally as a tool 
				for describing scientific documents, and has grown to become today’s standard markup 
				language for web pages.  HTML provides the building blocks for website building.</p>
			<p><strong>CSS</strong>, or <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>, is a style sheet 
				language used to format the visual presentation of documents written in markup 
				language—commonly, HTML—allowing the user to design the layout, color, fonts, and 
				more of their HTML pages.  Without CSS, HTML is minimalistic and difficult to read.  
				When CSS and HTML are combined, they create the engaging, readable websites to which 
				modern internet users are accustomed.</p>
			<p>I began to self-teach HTML and CSS in the summer of 2020.  I wanted to learn how to create 
				a website from scratch, so I created this personal website using GitHub Pages as a 
				host and HTML and CSS to build the site.  You can see the HTML and CSS I used to build 
				this site on <a href="https://github.com/Flittermischief/katcottrell.github.io">
				my GitHub repo</a>.</p>
