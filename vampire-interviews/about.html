          <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
          
          <p style="font-weight:bold;">
            What is the purpose of Nightlinks?
          </p>
          <p>
            Nightlinks serves with the mission to help members of the northeast goth and nightside scenes advertise, connect with collaborators, and find services within the community.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use Nightlinks to:  
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Promote your own work, goods, or services.
            </li>
            <li>
              Connect with others in your line of work for advice, collaboration, and references.
            </li>
            <li>
              Find providers for your goods and service needs.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p style="font-weight:bold;">
            How is Nightlinks different from mainstream professional networking platforms?
          </p>
          <p>
            Members of our community have unique advertising needs.  
            Many may not want their services associated with their public profile.  
            Goods and services may be targeted at very specific niches within the community.  
            We may prefer to collaborate with local, more personal connections.  
            Nightlinks strives to serve these needs.
          </p>
          
          <p style="font-weight:bold;">
            Who can be listed on Nightlinks?
          </p>
          <p>
            Nightlinks serves all members of the northeast goth and nightside community.  
          </p>
          <p>
            We welcome members of all dark and alternative scenes (goths, rivetheads, deathrockers, punks, and more) as we do all Nightkind (Magickal and Energy workers, Mystics, Vampyres, Therians, Fae, and more).    
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't worry if you fit in enough.  If it speaks to you, your presence is welcomed.  
          </p>
          <p>
            While Nightlinks serves the American northeast community (the greater Gotham Halo area: New York, Connecticut, New Jersey), non-northeasterners are welcome to submit listings if you think they will be of interest to members of the northeast community.
          </p>
          
          <p style="font-weight:bold;">
            Do I have to be a professional to be listed?
          </p>
          <p>
            We welcome entrepreneurs of all experience levels (although we ask that you represent your services honestly if you are very new).
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are not currently a paid professional, but are still very experienced or knowledgable about a topic and would like to be listed to support others in the area, Nightlinks gratefully welcomes your listing.
          </p>
          
          <p style="font-weight:bold;">
            Does Nightlinks screen the people or services listed?
          </p>
          <p>
            Because anyone can list their work, Nightlinks cannot vet or endorse the character or quality of any of our listings.  
          </p>
          <p>
            You are highly encouraged to do your own research and use your best judgement to find collaborators whose work and values align with your expectations.  
          </p>
          
          <p style="font-weight:bold;">
            What is the Discord?  Can I join?
          </p>
          <p>
            Discord is a social platform where Nightlink members can communicate in private channels just for others in their line of work.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="google.com">You can request to be added to the Discord here.</a>
          </p>
          
          <p style="font-weight:bold;">
            How does Nightlinks make money?
          </p>
          <p>
            It doesn't.  I'm doing this for fun and because I love you. <3
